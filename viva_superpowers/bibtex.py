"""Workspace bibliography (BibTeX) key extraction — single source of truth.

Before this, three call sites disagreed (framework streamlining screening,
Theme 3 / the one correctness finding):

- ``study_findings.load_bib_keys`` and ``report_linter._bib_keys_for_workspace``
  read ``references/papers.bib`` with a tolerant line parser.
- ``study_verify._load_bib_keys`` read a *different* file
  (``references/references.bib`` or ``references.bib``) with a *different*
  regex.

So a cite key could pass ``/pbg-study verify`` and fail ``/pbg-report`` lint
(or vice versa). This module gives all three one filename precedence and one
parser, so the verify gate and the publish gate agree.
