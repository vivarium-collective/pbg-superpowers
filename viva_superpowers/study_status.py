"""Derive a study's status from execution state (don't trust hand-set fields).

v2ecoli round-2 integration friction #2 (2026-05-22): a report shipped
``status: planning-with-baseline-confirmed`` and a "for expert review prior to
execution" tagline *after all 8 studies had executed with verdicts*. The
expert and the user caught it — no check did. The authored status string had
drifted from reality.

The robust fix is **derive-on-read**: compute the observably-derivable status
axes from execution state (runs.db + recorded verdicts) instead of trusting a
hand-maintained field that can't keep up. This module is the shared core both
the dashboard (live render) and the report (export) call, so a study's status
reflects what actually ran — by construction, it can't go stale.

Multi-axis status vocabulary (Pass A): design / implementation / simulation /
evaluation / gate / expert_review. Of these:

- ``simulation_status`` and ``evaluation_status`` are **observable** — fully
  derivable from runs + verdicts. This module derives them.
- ``design_status`` / ``implementation_status`` / ``expert_review_status`` are
  **authored intent** (was it designed? is the code written? did an expert
  sign off?) — not derivable from a run, so they pass through unchanged.
- ``gate_status`` mixes authored prerequisites with test outcomes; deriving it
  needs the test pass/fail signal and is left for a follow-up.

``status_disagreements`` reports where a *stored* axis contradicts its derived
value, so the report can surface "stored: planning / actual: ran" the way the
param-enforcement banner surfaces declared-vs-applied drift.
