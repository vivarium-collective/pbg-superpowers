"""Read/write accessors over the per-study runs.db `runs_meta` table — the
authoritative record of which runs belong to a study and which is latest.

`runs_meta.params_json` is the run-config provenance slot: a runner records
the decision-relevant knobs (applied perturbations, cache fingerprint, seed,
generations, ...) via :func:`register_run`, and any downstream consumer reads
them back with :func:`get_run_params`. The run_id is the run's
``experiment_id`` (the top parquet partition key), so a figure that carries
its run_id can always be traced back to the exact config that produced it.
