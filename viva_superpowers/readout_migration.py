"""readout_migration.py — migrate legacy study readouts to canonical form.

Sub-project #7 of the Readout-coordination design
(``docs/specs/2026-06-09-readout-coordination-design.md`` §5.7).

Converts a study's legacy readouts (the three dialects — ``identifier:`` magic
indices / bulk expressions, ``store_path:``, and authored ``index_by``) to the
canonical structured form, using ``readout_resolver`` as the single source of
truth.  SAFE by construction:

  * ``migrate_readouts(spec)`` is a **pure** function (no I/O).
  * Unresolvable readouts (prose ``·`` groups, ``derived``, ambiguous) are
    KEPT untouched and flagged ``needs_human`` in the report — never guessed.
  * ``migrate_study_file`` defaults to **dry-run** (``write=False``); when
    ``write=True`` it rewrites only the ``readouts:`` block via a ruamel
    round-trip, preserving comments and all hand-authored non-readout content.
    It is a **true no-op** when nothing actually changes (all readouts already
    canonical / ``needs_human``): the file is left byte-for-byte identical.

NOTE: canonicalization rebuilds each migrated readout dict from its resolved
selector, so inline YAML comments attached to an *individual readout entry* are
not preserved across a rewrite — acceptable, since the readout is the unit being
rewritten.  Comments on non-readout content (and on the ``readouts:`` key
itself) survive intact.

    Loads the study spec, runs the **pure** ``migrate_readouts`` (a dry-run —
    no file is ever touched), and sorts every readout into one of three
    buckets:

      * ``needs_human``  — unresolvable (prose ``·`` groups, ``derived``,
        ambiguous). The migration keeps these untouched; a human must
        re-author them against the composite's real observables. Carried
        straight from the report as ``[{name, reason}, ...]``.
      * ``migratable``   — resolvable AND the canonical form DIFFERS from the
        original. A ``migrate_study_file(write=True)`` would safely rewrite
        these (meaning-preserving). Returned as the *original* readout dicts.
      * ``canonical``    — resolvable AND already canonical (a dry-run migrate
        leaves them byte-identical). Nothing to do.

    This function performs NO writes — it only reads ``study.yaml``. The actual
    rewrite is ``migrate_study_file(write=True)``, invoked only by the skills.
