"""Failure-mode tests covering the testable in-process portions of spec §13.

Many of the §13 error modes are runtime-only (gh CLI, network, dashboard server,
submodule pointer divergence) and are exercised by the SKILL.md walkthroughs at
runtime, not by L1 tests. The cases below are the ones with pure-Python entry
points: schema corruption."""
